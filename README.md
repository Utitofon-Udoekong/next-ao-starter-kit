A production-ready template for building decentralized applications using Next.js and AO (Arweave Operating System). This template uses the Next.js 14 App Router and provides built-in AO integration patterns.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features
